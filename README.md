DESCRIPTION

This project aims at defining a simple Virtual Machine using C language.
The VM resembles the LC3 architecture which, although it is the easiest one, it represents the best way to approach low-level programming and mastering C language.
In the first steps, the main components of the machine are written as well as the 15 commands commonly included in the LC3 architecture.
